# Rocket League Recent Player Finder

This program will allow you to search through recent players on Rocket League so that you can add them to your friends list.  The way it works is by reading a log file to extract names and steam ids.  When a match occurs in a search the program will attempt to automatically open steamidfinder.com to show you the user's profile.
